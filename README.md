# diploma
For diploma work we are going to create the system for 
banks to evaluate the credit risks. We will build 
the scorecards using several machine learning 
algorithms. We plan to create the website 
for managers of bank to enter their personal 
information, this site will transfer information 
to database and this data will be taken by machine 
learning algorithms to give the client the score. 
Depending on this score these algorithms will decide 
whether accept the credit or decline. We will 
probably use logistic regression or xgboosting.
 We could also use random forest, but it is 
not suitable for all the 
cases(most common ones are log regression and xgb).
 We will build several scorecards to compare 
them and choose the best one.
